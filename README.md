# convenience-space-apps-challenge

This project is made in the Space App Challenge organized by NASA.

# Description

Currently, accessing information is often very bureaucratic, even though it is free. We believe that it could be much more beneficial for the scientific community to allow more direct access, centralized in one place, where queries can also be made to the creator, similar projects can be grouped, and the community itself can support or correct the information. The idea of a large repository allows any user to search based on names, keywords, or even filter by categories or subcategories. The concept of an 'open community' aims to promote teamwork rather than competition.

This project is a web application for the moment. Mock-up was created with Figma, to get the general design idea. Every code was written with Visual Studio Code with Next12 framework, typescript as the coding language, and Chakra UI for styling library. Deploy and database are hosted on Google Firebase. The code is saved on Git Hub.

For the design of this app, it was crucial to observe and analyze existing repositories from other communities such as GitHub, Thingiverse, GrabCAD, etc., where it can already be seen that not only is a repository rich in variety built within the same interest, but it also fosters a community that feeds itself. Each project promotes innovation for upcoming projects with previous 'know-how'.
